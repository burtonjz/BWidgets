/**
 *  @brief  Main %Window class of BWidgets.
 *
 *  The main %Window object controls the visibility of all linked Widgets. All
 *  Widgets need be be linked to the main %Window object to become visible.
 *
 *  The main %Window object also controls and routes the events emitted by the
 *  linked Widgets and by the host system in its event queue and its event
 *  handler. 
 *
 *  The full event routing process is:
 *  1.  Emission of an event either by a Widget either
 *      * by a host event and an assignment to a Widget by the main %Window
 *        translate function, or
 *      * by the Widget directly
 *      to the main %Window event queue.
 *  2.  Analyzing, merging and routing in the main %Window event handler and
 *      calling the Widget onXXX() method.
 *  3.  Responding in the Widget onXXX() method and optional call of a linked
 *      Callback function.
 *  4.  Optional, respond to the effect in a Callback function.
 *
 *  Note: There should only be one %Window object!
